# KNOWLEDGE-GRAPHS

This Github repository is my introductory project to the field of Natural Language Processing:-

The contents are:-
   | Different attempts as well as the final approach to deriving a knowledge graph on a scraped piece of text on 'Paracetamol' from wikipedia.
   | A short whitepaper on the concept of the knowledge graphs and how they are a path towards explainable AI in the future.
